  <h2>About Office Bhojanam</h2>

  <p class="about-intro">
    Office Bhojanam was started with one simple belief —
    office lunch should be proper, peaceful, and predictable.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many office employees struggle daily with lunch decisions —
    ordering outside food, skipping meals, or eating unhealthy options.
    We wanted to change that by offering reliable, home-style meals
    designed specifically for workdays.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our focus is not on variety or flashy menus.
    Instead, we focus on consistency, quality, and routine —
    so you can eat well without thinking about it every day.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether you choose a single meal, a flexible pass, or a monthly subscription,
    our goal remains the same:
    <strong>to make sure your lunch is taken care of.</strong>
  </p>

  <p class="about-closing">
    Eat properly. Work peacefully.
